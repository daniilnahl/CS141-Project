## DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the Trajectory-Optimized Avian Kinetics Simulator (TOAKS)! The goal of this game is to manipulate a ball to the right side of the screen by inputting an angle while dodging the objects simultaneously. There are 4 levels in total, and each level gets harder and harder. Can you rise to the challenge, and beat all 4?

## WHY DID WE DO THIS?
We wanted to see what would happen when combining elements of math, design, and command line programming. Using these principles, we were able to create a simplistic demonstration of physics working hand in hand with coding to form a trajectory styled Angry Birds-esque game. We hope that this serves as motivation to the computer development community, showcasing what happens when you mix different elements with coding.

## DESIGN
Keeping it simple, we opted for a command lined styled programming for the menu, as well as the Java drawing panel for the graphics. We also decided on adding "failed" and "pass" screens along with audio to the application which can be heard when in the menu of the game, and when the user either cleared or failed the levels. Furthermore, we decided on a username system, which saved the information of the user, allowing the user to see their progress when logging onto the game and saving it when logging off.  

## Features
> User log-in system
> Audio
> Implementation of physics in drawing panel.
